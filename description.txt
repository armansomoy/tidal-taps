TIDAL TAPS

What is Tidal Taps?

Tidal Taps is a mobile bar service. We operate a hand-crafted teardrop trailer that has been converted into a tap rental. 

How much does it cost to rent?

Tidal Tap rentals start at $675.00. Please tell us about your event, a brief description would do. Include the number of people you anticipate, the date and location. Each event is unique and with that comes different visions and costs. We have add-ons including organic balloon installations from Fiesta Balloons, lawn games and more!  We’d provide a customized and detailed quote. 

How many taps are there? 

We have three taps installed. This way you can serve a nice variety to your guests. In order to make the event inclusive, we can suggest and provide excellent non-alcoholic options. 

What is included? 

Included in your custom package will be;
Event planning and coordination 
Set up and take down
Use of taps
1-2 Tap-tenders

How big is the mobile bar?

The bar is roughly 11 feet by 6 feet - includes the teardrop trailer (8 feet by 4 feet), the hitch (3 feet) and the wheels and fenders (1 feet each side proud of the trailer).

Do you have a liquor license?

Due to liquor regulations in both Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, the host of the event must purchase the alcohol for the event.  We do not carry a liquor license but we will be there to serve your favourite local beverages and provide a unique and unforgettable ambiance. All of our servers have had the safer bartending course
 
Since we are BYOB, this allows you to save money! We will also work with you and guide you when purchasing the kegs for your event! The host might have to apply for a permit depending on location - we would be pleased to assist with this. Due to liquor laws and regulations in both NS and PEI we are unable to accommodate a cash bar.
